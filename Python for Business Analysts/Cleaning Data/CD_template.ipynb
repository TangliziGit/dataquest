    "Art is a messy business. Over centuries, artists have created everything from simple paintings to complex sculptures, and art historians have been cataloging everything they can along the way. The Museum of Modern Art, or MoMA for short, is considered one of the most influential museums in the world and recently released a dataset of all the artworks they’ve cataloged in their collection. This dataset contains basic information on metadata for each artwork and is part of MoMA's push to make art more accessible to everyone.\n",

As you become more familiar with Python and Pandas, you will become more comfortable reducing complexity by writing just one function to handle the patterns. Let's now see what that function could look like, by borrowing from the logic of the 3 functions we wrote above."
