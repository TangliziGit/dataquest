    "\n",
    "If you give both of them a project, since they both have different knowledge and experience, they'll both approach it in slightly different ways. They may both produce code that achieves the same result, but one may run faster in certain areas. The other may have a better interface. Even though both of them have about the same talent level, because they approach the problem differently, their solutions are stronger in different areas.\n",

Each tree makes different predictions in different areas. Even though both trees have about the same accuracy, when we combine them, the result is stronger because it leverages the strengths of both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more \"diverse\", or dissimilar, the models used to construct an ensemble, the stronger the combined predictions will be (assuming that all models have about the same accuracy). Ensembling a decision tree and a logistic regression model, which use very different approaches to arrive at their answers, will result in stronger predictions than ensembling two decision trees with similar parameters.\n",

Ensembling a model with a .75 AUC and a model with a .85 AUC on a test set will usually result in an AUC somewhere in between the two original values. There's a way around this which we'll discuss later on, called weighting."

Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all the trees, whereas each tree will hone into the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal.\n",

    "- Very accurate predictions -- Random forests achieve near state of the art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient boosted trees, they are typically one of the top performing algorithms.\n",
