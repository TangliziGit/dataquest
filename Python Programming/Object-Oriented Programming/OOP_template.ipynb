Inheriting from a class means that the behavior of the parent also exists in the child, but that the child can still define its own additional behavior.\n",

    "Consider a Player class with generic information about NBA players. This is very useful, and there are a lot of things players have in common, but we may want specific behavior for different positions. We can define classes like Center, Forward, or Point Guard, each with behavior that is specific to that position. These classes would each specify Player as its parent class. They would all be siblings, and would each inherit the same behaviors from the Player class, while also containing special behaviors of their own.\n",

    "In Python 3, every class is a subclass of a generic object class. This is done automatically when an ancestor is not specified, but it's sometimes good practice to be explicit. When we define classes for the remainder of this mission, we will explicitly specify when a class has object as its parent. This is a good programming practice because if we get in the habit of specifying a class's ancestry, we won't forget to specify a parent when the parent class is something other than object.

The operators work because classes like string have implemented them specifically. However, it's a little difficult to understand why the object class would need to have these methods. The best way to understand is through example.\n",

    "Let's imagine the + operator. The object class defines a method for addition. The sum() function is defined using the addition method, but the object class doesn't really know how to add integers or floating points specifically. However, the integer and float classes define their own addition method (thus overloading the object's addition method), and the sum() function will add the values together properly. This is very powerful, since sum() only had to be defined once, can be called on a multitude of classes, and results in proper behavior. This is the power of inheritance and overloading."
