# ###1: Writing a while loop

# Before we dive into analyzing the data, we need to learn a few more things about loops.
# 
# A for loop isn't the only kind of loop.
# 
# One other type of loop is called a while loop.
# 
# It will keep running the loop as long as the condition specified is True.
# 
#     x = 2
#     while x == 2:
#         print(x)
# 
# The code above will run forever, because the loop will keep testing to see if x equals 2, and it will always return True.
# 
# You have to be careful not to get into an infinite loop, or a loop that runs forever, when you use a while loop.
# 
#     x = 2
#     while x == 3:
#         print(x)
# 
# The code above won't run at all, because x will never equal three.

# ####Instructions

# Create a while loop that tests if b is greater than 5. If it is, the loop body should print b out, then subtract one from it.

# In[2]:

x = 3
# The loop body will execute three times.  Once when x == 3, once when x == 4, and once when x == 5.
# Then x < 6 will evaluate to False, and it will stop.
# 3, 4, and 5 will be printed out.
while x < 6:
    print("x:", x)
    # Using += is a shorter way of saying x = x + 1.  It will add one to x.
    x += 1

b = 10
while b > 5:
    print("b:", b)
    b -= 1


# ###2: Using the break keyword

# The break keyword can be used to stop a loop early.
# 
# This can be useful in for loops when something happens inside the loop that makes us need to end it early.
# 
#     dog_available = False
#     desired_dog = "Great Dane"
#     available_dogs = ["Labrador", "Poodle", "Sheepdog", "Great Dane", "Pomeranian"]
#     for dog in available_dogs:
#         if dog == desired_dog:
#             dog_available = True
#             break
# 
# The code above will check to see if the desired_dog is available, and stop looping if it is found.

# ####Instructions

# Let's say we want two "Bengal" tigers from available_tigers for our nature reserve.
# 
# Write a for loop that breaks after finding two, and increments tiger_count when it finds one.

# In[3]:

available_count = 0
desired_dog = "Great Dane"
available_dogs = ["Labrador", "Poodle", "Sheepdog", "Great Dane", "Pomeranian", "Great Dane", "Collie"]

# Let's say we are searching for two dogs of the same breed to adopt.
# We'll loop through the dogs.
for dog in available_dogs:
    # If our desired dog is found.
    if dog == desired_dog:
        # Increment the counter.
        available_count += 1
        # We only want two dogs, so we can stop searching after we find them.
        if available_count == 2:
            break

tiger_count = 0
desired_tiger = "Bengal"
available_tigers = ["Bengal", "Dressed up poodle", "Siberian", "Sumatran", "Bengal", "Housecat", "Hobbes"]
for tiger in available_tigers:
    if tiger == desired_tiger:
        tiger_count += 1
        if tiger_count == 2:
            break


# ###3: Finding a column number from a name

# The data is in the flight_delays variable, and the column names are in the column_names variable.
# 
# So far, we've been numbering columns and selecting them using numbers, but it can get pretty painful to do this when there are more than 10 columns.
# 
# One fix for this is to refer to the columns by name, and write a function that returns a column number for a given column name.

# ####Instructions

# Write a function that will get the column number from the column name.
# 
# Use it to get the column number for the "arr_delay" column and assign it to the arr_delay variable.
# 
# Use it to get the column number for the "weather_delay" column and assign it to the weather_delay variable.

# ###4: Using negative indexing

# We can index lists with negative values.
# 
# Positive indexes start getting values from the beginning of a list, but negative indexes get values from the end of a list.

# ####Instructions

# Use negative indexing to assign the third to last row in flight_delays to third_to_last.
# 
# Use negative slicing to assign the fourth, third, and second to last rows in flight_delays to end_slice.

# In[5]:

# Prints the last row in flight_delays.
print("flight_delays[-1]:", flight_delays[-1])

# Prints the second to last row in flight_delays.
print("flight_delays[-2]:", flight_delays[-2])

# Prints the third to last and second to last rows in flight_delays
# (remember that slicing only goes up to but not including the second number)
# This will get the rows at index -3 and -2.
print("flight_delays[-3:-1]", flight_delays[-3:-1])
third_to_last = flight_delays[-3]
end_slice = flight_delays[-4:-1]


# ###5: Indexing up to the end or from the beginning

# When we take a slice, we can leave one of the numbers blank.

# ####Instructions

# Assign the first 10 rows of flight_delays to first_ten_rows.
# 
# Assign the last 10 rows of flight_delays to last_ten_rows.

# In[6]:

# This code will get the rows at index 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
first_five_rows = flight_delays[:5]

# This will get the rows at index -5, -4, -3, -2, and -1

# ###6: Finding the percentage of delayed flights

# We can now find the percentage of flights that are delayed.

# ####Instructions

# Sum together the values in the "arr_del15" column. This is the total number of arriving flights in each airport that were delayed more than 15 minutes.
# 
# Then, divide the number of delayed flights by total_arriving_flights. Assign the result to delayed_percentage.

# ###7: Finding the average delay time

# The total amount of time (in minutes) that planes for a given carrier were delayed at a given airport is in "arr_delay" column.

# ####Instructions

# Find the sum of the "arr_delay" column.
# 
# Then, divide it by the sum of the "arr_del15" column to get the average number of minutes a plane was delayed.
# 
# Assign the result to average_delay_time.

# ###8: Making a function to calculate the delay

# There are a few more columns that we'll need to calculate the sum of, and its getting a bit tedious to keep typing the same few commands.
# 
# Let's make a function to save ourselves time.

# ####Instructions

# Make a function that takes a column name as input, and returns the column sum.
# 
# Then use the function to take the sum of the "weather_delay" column, and divide it by the sum of the "arr_del15" column.
# 
# Assign the result to average_weather_delay_time.

# ###9: Named arguments to functions

# We can use named keyword arguments to pass input to a function.

# ####Instructions

# Fix the statements above so the code runs properly.
# 
# The first statement should divide 5 by 20, and the second should divide 100 by 30.

# In[10]:

def divide(x, y):
    return float(x)/y

# Use positional arguments, which will implicitly pass 10 to x and 5 to y.
print("divide(10,5):", divide(10,5))

# Use named arguments, which will pass the values to the named variable.
print("divide(y=10, x=5):", divide(y=10, x=5))

# If we use named arguments, the order doesn't matter
print("divide(x=5, y=10):", divide(x=5, y=10))

# But we can't have any positional arguments after we use a named argument

# ###10: Optional arguments to a function

# We can also specify default values in a function definition that make the arguments optional.
# 
# You can't have an optional argument before a non-optional argument, just like named keywords.

# ####Instructions

# Fix the last two statements so that they work properly.
# 
# The first statement should multiply 4 * 3 * 1
# 
# The second statement should multiply 3 * 2 * 3

# In[11]:

# ###11: Finding delay by carrier

# Now that we know about optional and keyword arguments, let's make a function that can find the average delay for a given airport.

# ####Instructions

# Fill in the rest of the find_average_delay function.
# 
# You can calculate average delay time by dividing the "arr_delay" column by the "arr_del15" column.
# 
# The "carrier" column can be used to subset by carrier.
# 
# Then use the function to assign the average delay time to average_delay_time.
