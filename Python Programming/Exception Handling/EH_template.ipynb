    "Typically when we write Python code, the interpretter will raise an exception (report an error) and keep executing the rest of the code after that exception is raised. We will see the exception, but our program will keep running as if it never happened. This is undesireable, because our program likely relies on previous statements being executed properly in order to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we want to handle exceptions. We want to observe when an exception is raised, and react accordingly. This way, every piece of code that is executed is executed deliberately, and we have complete control over what our program does. In Python, we use a try-except block to handle exceptions. Observe the following piece of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        impossible_value = int(\"Not an integer\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot convert string to integer\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "When the Python interpretter sees this code, it first attempts to execute the code in the try section of the statement. If any exceptions are raised within the try section (we hit some sort of error), our code will attempt to catch it, or gracefully handle it with different code. As it happens, our except statement will catch the exception because ValueError is the appropriate exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this code block:\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        f = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "        s = f.readline()\n",
    "        i = float(s)\n",

    "        print(\"Cannot convert data to floating point value\")\n",
    "    except IOError:\n",
    "        print(\"Could not read file\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we caught a couple different types of exceptions that we suspected could arise during the execution of the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers the ability to catch any exception by simply writing an except: section without specifying an exception. This is a sort of \"catch-all\", and it works like an else: statement. However, using a catch-all for exceptions is usually bad practice. Trying to catch every exception without being specific is dangerous, since you can't execute exception-specific logic, and it means you may not understand your code as fully as you should.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you catch every exception in one statement, you can't react to the exception that was raised because you have no idea what exception was raised. Instead, you should try catching as many specific exceptions as you possibly can. Think about what exceptions your code could cause, then catch and react to each one individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, there are still times when a catch-all after you have caught all of your expected exceptions is a good idea. You may want to catch the unknown exception, store it somewhere so that later on you can find what went wrong, and change your code to handle that particular exception."
