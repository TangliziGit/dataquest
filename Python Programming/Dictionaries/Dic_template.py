# ###1: Parsing the file

# Our data is in a CSV file, so we'll need to parse it before we can get started.

# ####Instructions

# Open "la_weather.csv", parse it, and assign the result to weather_data.

# In[2]:

# ###2: Getting a single column from the data

# The first column of the data isn't very useful to what we're doing, so let's get rid of it and only work with the second column.

# ####Instructions

# Get all of the values in the second column and append them to weather_column.

# In[3]:

# ###3: Pre-defined variables

# Loop over the weather variable, and set count equal to the number of items in weather.

# ####Instructions

# Loop over the weather variable, and set count equal to the number of items in weather.

# ###4: Practice slicing a list

# Now that we know how to slice lists, let's practice.

# ####Instructions

# Assign a slice containing index 2 and 3 from slice_me to slice1. Assign a slice containing index 1 from slice_me to slice2. Assign a slice containing index 3 and 4 from slice_me to slice3.

# In[5]:

# ###5: Removing our header

# Now that we can slice lists, let's remove the header from the weather data.

# ####Instructions

# The weather data is in the weather variable. Slice the data and remove the header. The slice can end at 367. Assign the result to new_weather.

# In[6]:

new_weather = weather[1:367]

# ###6: Making a dictionary

# Use curly braces to define a dictionary -- {} -- and then you add keys.

# ####Instructions

# Assign the value 5 to the key "test" in dictionary_two. Assign the value "hello" to the key 10 in dictionary_two.

# In[7]:

# Make dictionary.
dictionary_one = {}

# Add keys and values.
dictionary_one["key_one"] = 2

# Dictionaries can have multiple keys.

# Make dictionary.
dictionary_two = {}

# Add keys and values.
dictionary_two["test"] = 5
dictionary_two[10] = "hello"
print("dictionary_two:", dictionary_two)


# ###7: Indexing a dictionary

# We can index dictionaries with square brackets. a = dictionary[10] will get the value stored in the dictionary for the key 10 and assign it to a.

# ####Instructions

# Assign the value in "key1" in dictionary_two to a. Assign the value in "key2" in dictionary_two to b. Assign the value in "key3" in dictionary_two to c.

# In[8]:

# Make dictionary.

b = dictionary_two["key2"]
print("b:", b)

c = dictionary_two["key3"]
print("c:", c)


# ###8: Defining a dictionary with values

# We can define a dictionary that already contains values.

# ####Instructions

# Make a dictionary c with the keys 7, 8, and 9 corresponding to the values "raven", "goose", and "duck". Make a dictionary d with the keys "morning", "afternoon", "evening", and "night" corresponding to the values 9, 14, 19, and 23.

# In[9]:

# Define dictionary that already contains values.
a = {"key1": 10, "key2": "indubitably", "key3": "dataquest", 3: 5.6}
print("a:", a)

# Define dictionary that already contains values.
b = {4: "robin", 5: "bluebird", 6: "sparrow"}
print("b:", b)
print("b[4]:", b[4])

# Define dictionary that already contains values.
c = {7: "raven", 8: "goose", 9: "duck"}
print("c:", c)

# Define dictionary that already contains values.
d = {"morning": 9, "afternoon": 14, "evening": 19, "night": 23}
print("d:", d)
print("d['morning']:", d["morning"])


# ###9: Testing if items are in a list

# Let's practice testing if items are in a list.

# ####Instructions

# Check if 9 is in list2, and assign the result to c. Check if 8 is in list2, and assign the result to d. Check if -1 is in list2, and assign the result to e.

# In[10]:

# Create list.
the_list = [10,60,-5,8]
print("the_list:", the_list)

# Print whether 10 is in 'the_list' using an 'in' statement.
print("10 in the_list:", 10 in the_list)

# Print whether -5 is in 'the_list' using an 'in' statement.
print("-5 in the_list:", -5 in the_list)

# Print whether 9 is in 'the_list' using an 'in' statement.
print("9 in the_list:", 9 in the_list)

# Assign the result of an in statement to a variable.
a = 7 in the_list

d = 8 in list2
print("d:", d)

e = -1 in list2
print("e:", e)


# ###10: More uses for the in statement

# We can also use the in statement to check if a key is in a dictionary. We do this the same way we check if a value is in a list.

# ####Instructions

# Check whether "jupiter" is in dict2 and assign the result to b. Check whether "earth" is in dict2 and assign the result to c.

# In[11]:

# Define dictionary that already contains values.

print("'robin' in the_dict:", "robin" in the_dict)

# Print whether crow is in 'the_dict' using an 'in' statement.
print("'crow' in the_dict:", "crow" in the_dict)

# Assign the result of an in statement to a variable.
a = "cardinal" in the_dict
print("a:", a)

# Define dictionary that already contains values.

print("dict2", dict2)

b = "jupiter" in dict2
print("b:", b)

c = "earth" in dict2
print("c:", c)


# ###11: Practicing with the else statement

# The else statement is a powerful way to extend a basic if statement.

# ####Instructions

# Write an if statement that prints "It's hot!" when the season is "Summer" Add an else statement to the if that prints "It might be hot!".

# In[12]:

# Code in an else statement will be executed if the if statement boolean is False.

else:
    print("It might be hot!")


# ###12: Counting with dictionaries

# We can combine some of the concepts we've already learned to count how many times items appear in a list using dictionaries. We'll loop over the list, and create a key for each item we want to count. We then increment the key whenever we see the element again. At the end, we have the count.

# ####Instructions

# Count how many times each presidential last name appears in us_presidents. Assign the counts to us_president_counts.

# In[13]:

# Create list.

# ###13: Counting the weather!

# We now know how to count up how many times each type of weather occurs in the data!

# ####Instructions

# The weather column, minus the header, has been loaded into the weather variable. Count up how many times each type of weather occurs. Store the counts in weather_counts.

# In[14]:

# Create an empty dictionary.
weather_counts = {}
# Loop through the list.
