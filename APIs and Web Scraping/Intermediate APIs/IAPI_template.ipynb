With an access token, you can revoke it if there is a security breach and someone gets access to it. This will cancel their access.\n",

For instance, you can make a token that has permission to write to your Github repositories and make new ones, or you can make a token that can only read from your repositories. This enables you to enforce token security better, and use tokens that only have read access in potentially insecure or shared scripts.\n",

Just like the server sends us headers in response to our request, we can send the server headers when we make a request. Headers contain metadata about the request. With the requests library, we just make a dictionary of headers, and then pass it into the request when we make it.\n",
