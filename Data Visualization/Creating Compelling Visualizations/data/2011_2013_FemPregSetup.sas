 |                      SAS PREGNANCY DATA SETUP FILE 
 |
 |
 | SAS SETUP SECTIONS ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ASCII VERSION OF THIS DATA
 | COLLECTION.  THESE SECTIONS ARE LISTED BELOW:
 |
 | PROC FORMAT:  CREATES USER-DEFINED FORMATS FOR THE VARIABLES. FORMATS
 | REPLACE ORIGINAL VALUE CODES WITH VALUE CODE DESCRIPTIONS. ONLY
 | VARIABLES WITH USER-DEFINED FORMATS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION.
 |
 | DATA:  BEGINS A SAS DATA STEP AND NAMES AN OUTPUT SAS DATA SET.
 |
 | INFILE:  IDENTIFIES THE INPUT FILE TO BE READ WITH THE INPUT STATEMENT.
 | USERS MUST REPLACE THE 'DATA-FILENAME' WITH A FILENAME SPECIFYING THE
 | DIRECTORY ON THE USER'S COMPUTER SYSTEM IN WHICH THE DOWNLOADED AND
 | UNZIPPED DATA FILE IS PHYSICALLY LOCATED (E.G., 'C:\TEMP\DATA.DAT').
 |
 | INPUT:  ASSIGNS THE NAME, TYPE, DECIMAL SPECIFICATION (IF ANY), AND
 | SPECIFIES THE BEGINNING AND ENDING COLUMN LOCATIONS FOR EACH VARIABLE
 | IN THE DATA FILE.
 |
 | LABEL:  ASSIGNS DESCRIPTIVE LABELS TO ALL VARIABLES. VARIABLE LABELS
 | AND VARIABLE NAMES MAY BE IDENTICAL FOR SOME VARIABLES.
 |
 | MISSING VALUE NOTE:  TO MAINTAIN THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF MISSING CODES,
 | USERS MAY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SAS MISSING VALUES (THE LETTERS
 | A-Z OR AN UNDERSCORE PRECEDED BY A PERIOD).
 |
 | AN EXAMPLE OF A STANDARD MISSING VALUE RECODE:
 |
 |   IF (RELATION = 98 OR RELATION = 99) THEN RELATION = .; 
 |
 | THE SAME EXAMPLE USING SPECIAL MISSING VALUE RECODES:
 |
 |    IF RELATION = 98 THEN RELATION = .A;
 |    IF RELATION = 99 THEN RELATION = .B;
 |
 | FORMAT:  ASSOCIATES THE FORMATS CREATED BY THE PROC FORMAT STEP WITH
 | THE VARIABLES NAMED IN THE INPUT STATEMENT.
 |
 | USERS SHOULD MODIFY THIS SETUP FILE TO SUIT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.
 | To include these sections in the final SAS setup, users should remove the
 | SAS comment indicators from the desired section(s).
