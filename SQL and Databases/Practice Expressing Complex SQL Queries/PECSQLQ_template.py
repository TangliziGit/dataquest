# ###1: Introduction

# In this challenge, we'll continue working with the same table containing data on job outcomes by college major, for recent grads only, but will allow you to practice writing your own SQL queries.

# ###2: Select and Limit

# ####Instructions

# Write a query that retrieves:
# 
# The first 20 majors in the table, only these columns in the following order:
# 
# - College_jobs
# - Median
# - Unemployment_rate
# 
# Store the results in a variable named results.

# In[3]:

query = """
SELECT College_jobs, Median, Unemployment_rate
FROM recent_grads
LIMIT 20;
"""
results = conn.execute(query).fetchall()

for row in results:
    print(row)


# ###3: Where

# ####Instructions

# Write a query that returns the first 5 Arts majors (only include the Major column). Store the results in a variable named five_arts.

# In[4]:

query = """
SELECT major
FROM recent_grads 
WHERE Major_category = 'Arts'
LIMIT 5;
"""

for row in results:

# ###4: Operators

# ####Instructions

# Return all non-engineering majors with a median salary less than or equal to 50,000 or an unemployment rate higher than 6.5%.
# 
# Return only these columns in the following order:
# 
# - Major
# - Total
# - Median
# - Unemployment_rate
# 
# Store the results in a variable named non_engineering.

# In[5]:

# In[6]:
