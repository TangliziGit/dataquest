Since this may not make sense for all queries, SQL comes with a statement, ORDER BY, that allows us to specify, for each query, how we'd like the database to order the results. Using ORDER BY , we can specify not only the column we'd like the database to use to order the results by but also whether we'd like them in ascending (ASC), low to high, or descending (DESC), high to low, order. SQL uses the standard methods of ordering: alphabetically for text fields and numerically for numeric fields.\n",
