Thankfully, PySpark lets you define a function first in Python and pass that in. For any function that is returning a sequence of data (versus a guaranteed Boolean value, like filter() requires) in PySpark, the function needs to use a yield statement to specify the values to be pulled later.\n",

The quick summary is that'yield' is a technique in Python that allows \"data to be generated on the fly\" and pulled when necessary instead of stored to memory immediately. Because of its unique architecture, Spark takes advantage of this to reduce overhead and improve the speed of computations.\n",

Each instance of the function only has access to the object(s) passed into the function and the Python libraries available in your environment. Trying to refer to variables outside the scope of the function or importing libraries can all cause the computation to crash since the function code is compiled down to Java code to run on the RDD objects (also in Java). Lastly, not all functions require the use of yield, only ones that generate a custom sequence of data. For map() or for filter(), you use return to return a value for every single element in the RDD you're running the functions on."
